# es6-web-app-skeleton

The skeleton of a web application with native ES6 custom elements, ES6 modules, ES6 features and unit tests.

Features:
 * There are no polyfills included in this skeleton. That is why you have to use Chrome Headless for testing.
 * Handlebars.js is used for templating. Template literals are not very useful for that.
 * Gulp is used as a build system.
 * Testing stack: Karma, Mocha, Chai, Sinon.
